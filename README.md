- **Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like **Median Yearly Salary and Job Count**.
- **Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line and Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time. 
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs. 
- **KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data
- **Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
- **Interactive Reporting:**
  -   **Slicers:** to dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
